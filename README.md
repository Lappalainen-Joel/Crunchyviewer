# Crunchyviewer
Wrapper script for liveviewer. Solely purpose is to view crunchyroll's videos. 

Usage: crunchyviewer.py [series-name], or without any parameters

22.12.2016: Added separate configuration file for setting up livestreamer executable path, separate player and defining quality.
            as well added support for running crunchyviewer with series-name. 
            
            
Upcoming:  livestreamer API usage, so that crunchyviewer can work just as standalone 'application', without relying on external executable.
